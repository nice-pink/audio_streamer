# What?

This is a bundle of modules to stream and receive audio, plain data, metadata or all together.

The idea is to simulate audio streaming of any protocol for test cases.

# How?

Everything needed for pure (audio) data and shoutcast/icecast is already contained in this repository.

# Examples

## Example 1 - Stream and receive data:

1. Open two terminals.
2. Start `data_streamer` and `data_receiver` with same `port`. Define `filepath` as streamer parameter.

Terminal A:
```
python3 -m data_streamer test_files/sweep_5sec.mp3 127.0.0.1 9222
```

Terminal B:
```
python3 -m data_receiver 127.0.0.1 9222
```

## Example 2 - Stream and receive shoutcast with additional metadata endpoint:

1. Open three terminals.
2. Start `zetta_streamer` and `shoutcast_receiver` with same `port`. Define `filepath` as streamer parameter. As additional metadata are sent to an additional http server, add metadata receiver url and optionally a port.
3. Start `http_receiver`.

Terminal A:
```
python3 -m zetta_streamer test_files/sweep_5sec.mp3 "127.0.0.1" 9222 "127.0.0.1" 8000
```

Terminal B:
```
python3 -m shoutcast_receiver "127.0.0.1" 9222
```

Terminal C:
```
python3 -m http_receiver "127.0.0.1" 8000
```
